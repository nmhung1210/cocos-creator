All assets that require dynamically loaded , could be placed under the resources folder or any bundle folder. Bundle folder is the same as resources folder. When the project is built, all assets (includes scene) in the bundle folder, along with assets outside the folder they are associated with, will be exported. Please use `cc.assetManager.loadBundle` to load bundle first, and then load asset in this bundle with `Bundle.load` and so on.

The bundle can be set with different priorities.There are 10 levels about the priority.The editor will build bundles in order of priority. if different bundles with different priority contain a shared asset, it is perferred to place the shared asset into the bundle with higher priority and other bundles only store a record, so that the bundle with lower priority will depend on the bundle with higher priority and the bundle with higher priority need to be loaded before others. On the other hand, if different bundles with same priority contain a shared asset, every bundle will store a copy of shared asset, so that bundles have no dependency and can be loaded in any order. Please make the bundle which contains the shared asset likes `Texture`, `Audio`, `SpriteFrame` have a higher priority for reducing the package size.
